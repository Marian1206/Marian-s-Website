    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
    <p> Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish.  The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</p>
    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
    <p> We face a rate of unemployment that is more than 3 times as high as the rest of the population and experience similar gaps in educational achievement. Interestingly, 75% of people who experience a form of disability in America who are not employed want to work. Around 30% of high school graduates with disabilities enroll in a college, while 40% of the overall population does. One year after high school graduation, a mere 10% of students with disabilities enroll in two-year colleges, and a meager 5% enroll in four-year colleges.<br>Even though America has the world's most comprehensive policy related to Internet accessibility and clear guidance for creating accessible technologies is in existence, designers and developers of hardware technologies and Web software in academia, industry, and government many times exploit gaps in existing policies to ignore the needs of people who experience forms of disabilities.</p>
    <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
