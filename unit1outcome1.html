<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 1</h1>
<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
<p> My opinion is without IT (information technology) and system support, businesses simply stop! If the internet or phone service goes down in an office, nothing can get done. Finance, operations, communications, sales, and all other departments depend on functional computer and information systems to complete their work. Plus, IT and IS (information services) protect the integrity of data and keep it safe from a world of technological threats. 
<br>    
Most people are using modern technology to do various activities. Life has become more convenient and enjoyable.    
I can give you some examples of how the IT industry made our lives easier, and what it was like to do without IT during the pandemic: improving Health Care, secure online payments,  grocery and clothes shopping online, watch movies online,GPS makes traveling a lot easier.</p>
<h2>1.2  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?.</h2>
<p> A digital project is an individual or collaborative undertaking carefully planned to achieve an aim in introducing, transforming, or managing digital strategies and operations in or with your organisation.
<br>
What I've learned for a project to be successful especially ones involving coding, you need methods and skills. Every time focus on your main duties,to be organized, to communicate, you need a lot of patience and spend as much time searching.</p>
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board.</h2>
<p><a href="https://trello.com/b/h8lGSNw2/marian">My Trello board</a></p>
<p> Everything I learned in this course that the, planning is an essential part of creating websites. It is often as important as the website development itself. A good website project plan can help you. 
<br>
Planning ahead reduce risks and possible problems during development, manages time and resources better, performs tasks with greater efficiency.</p>
<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h2>
<p> The interesting thing about digital projects is that, despite the regularity of their failure, they tend to fail for simple reasons. We all know very well how important the internet has become and how much it makes our daily lives easier. 
<br>
Well think how you could start a project without having internet, it is very important to have the antivirus with the update done, be very careful not to click on links that you know nothing about them can lead to data loss.</p>
<h2>1.5  Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?.</h2>
<p> What I learned in these weeks to complete a project as a software developer, first you need to know how to use python in vs code. At work, at home it depends on where you work, you need to have an office, a comfortable chair because most of the time you spend it on your chair. 
<br>    
You also need a high-performance laptop or computer and most importantly the internet, we all know without the internet the world does not work.</p>
<h2>1.6  Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control.</h2>
<p> The most beautiful experience in this course was when we were divided into teams and created our own game in vs code using python. Besides the fact that it was beautiful, it was also very intense. I want to mention that Trello helped us keep in mind what we have to do and what we did.</p>
<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
<p> The internet has dramatically changed the way we communicate and the way we manage our daily tasks. We send emails, we share documents, we pay bills and we purchase goods by entering our personal details all online and without a second thought.
<br>
Have you ever stopped to wonder how much personal data you have shared online? Or what happens to that information?. We’re talking about banking information, contacts, addresses, social media posts, and even your IP address and the sites that you’ve visited are all stored digitally.
<br>
What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address.</p>
