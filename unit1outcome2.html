    <h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>
    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</h2>
    <p> Vs code and trello were very helpful for me to be able to do my project. I really like working in vs code I still have to learn but in principle I manage considering that it is something new for me.
    <br>
    But I certainly believe that through a lot of work I will be able to accomplish what I set out to do, and to have the opportunity to work with experienced people from where I can learn a lot.
    </p>
    <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</h2>
    <p> I like Trello a lot for managing ideas and tasks.Trello uses markdown, which comes in handy here. Anyone editing content in a trello card is able to apply basic text formatting and have the same markdown flow into the site and transformed into HTML by a build process.
    <br>
    Visual Studio Code is a briliant tool. Most of the time I used vs code and if you are careful it is very easy to understand how to make a website and I am proud that I managed to make one.
    </p>
    <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
    <p> I am very proud of what I have achieved so far, I even exceeded my expectations. I know I still have a lot of work to do to make the project look as professional as possible.
    This is the beginning for me and I will definitely continue to improve my skills.<br>
    It definitely needs a lot of improvements in graphics, background, text, colors. I'm looking forward to continually develop my HTML skills and to built more and better websites into the future.</p>
    <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</h2>
    <p> No matter how well you perform any task, you can always do better than you did yesterday. The same goes for your work performance. Focusing on continuously improving your skill set and learning new things is a great way to boost your confidence and help you become the best version of yourself. 
    <br>
    I know that my project needs a lot of improvements and that in the future I need to be more focused, more organized, a lot of research and to be more focused and avoid distractions.</p>
    <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
    <p> From my experience I want to believe that my project meets all the requirements. I can say now that my project is as per the assessment brief.</p>
