    <h1>Unit 1 Oucome 3</h1>
    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    <p> The benefits of the IT tools, such as Slack or Zoom —some of the biggest benefits using slack or zoom were that working in teams on the pervious project, made us to trust ourselves and our colleagues, in order to open ourselves and ask for help when and where we felt stuck. Slack was also a great way for sharing documents and information among our pears.
    <br>
    Could we have done this project in teams—yes, we could. However, doing the project on our own was not as fun as could have been if we were working in teams. But I believe that working on our own, it was more challenging and we had to find solutions in those moments when we got stuck without anyone's help.</p>
    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
    <p> Have you ever looked up at the clock at the end of the workday and felt that you just didn’t get enough done? Are you working at home or on your commute and still not hitting your target outcome? Why is it that you haven’t yet discovered how to improve efficiency at work? 
    <br>
    Setting goals is critical to success. We can create goals to help shape our paths – this can be an effective way to improve work efficiency. Unfortunately, we may not have assigned realistic deadlines to those goals – or we may have reached too high. Compelling goals are important, but you also need to assess how much time and resources your goal(s) requires. We often think we can skip from step A to Z to reach our goal, when in reality there are lots of steps in between that need to be accounted for. Keep your end goal (Z) in mind, but don’t overestimate the importance of steps B, C, D and so on.</p>
    <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
    <p> Technological progress is exponential with the rate of growth in a vast array of metrics doubling in ever decreasing timeframes. This means that organisations are faced with the impossible task of having to make decisions about the benefits of a vast number of technologies. This complexity combined with poor advice explains why most digital transformation projects fail.</p>
    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
    <p> A lot of research has been done to identify the root causes of software startups failures. One of the main reasons for such failures turned out to be poor quality assurance during the software development process. Digital testing creates optimal user experiences. From mobile to mobile web and desktop browsers, all platforms need to be tested. 
    <br>
     Digital testing may include usability, accessibility, and other types of testing. Due to market fragmentation, digital testing is more complicated than ever. In the past, organizations were able to easily define their target devices and platforms on which to test their products. But today the reality of digital testing is much more complicated.</p>
